Self-taught and curious, my interests are software development and data science.
I particularly like working with technologies like : PHP using Symfony Framework, Python and Java.
I am currently working as a Home Technical Assistance Advisor and as a freelancer at Freelance Informatique, I participate in volunteer projects and I help people and companies develop new applications and maintain existing applications in PHP using Symfony Framework. I am comfortable with Java and Python languages. I speak French and have a good English level.
