    description: This program is based more on computer theory. Theoretical computer science is a branch of computer science that focuses on the study of the mathematical and conceptual foundations of computer science. It explores abstract ideas, formal models and algorithms to understand the capabilities and limitations of computer systems. In the course of my years of learning, I have come to appreciate the various sub-fields, such as algorithmic complexity theory, automata and formal language theory, graph theory, computational logic, and many others. These fields study fundamental questions such as the difficulty of algorithmic problems, the structure of formal languages, pattern recognition, program verification and more.

  - title: Bachelor's degree in Applird Mathematic - Computer Science - Econometrics

    description: The Applied Mathematics in Computer Science and Econometrics course offered by the ISM group enabled me to acquire solid knowledge, enabling me to analyze economic situations using mathematical tools. This training provided me with the tools I needed to contribute to decision-making, recommending solutions and areas for improvement, and forecasting within the organization. This involved mastering data management, the mathematical and statistical approach, and the tools of economic analysis. This training also enabled me to acquire scientific skills in mathematics applied to modern business management sciences, as well as in economics and IT.
